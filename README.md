# What is Droom?

## Proposal

Droom means dream in Dutch. This app helps you find your dream job by swiping right. Think Tinder + LinkedIn.

## Features

* Easily create/setup a user profile all in one location
* Onboard Processing for companies
* Easy setup processes for company profiles and job listings
* Allows both the User and the employer to have a swipe feature when they see a profile page
* View all your matches in one convenient location

## Target Audience
Our primary focus is to turn the job market search on its head. The only differene that has sustained over time was the introduction of technology since originally finding jobs in our local papers. We want to eliminate the use of multiple locations and allow both the employers and user to only have to utilize one singular application. So with that said, our audience is YOU!

## Extra tools used
The UI was built in a third party design tool called Figma. All attached images/files were created in there from scratch and then imported to the IDE and manipulated.
